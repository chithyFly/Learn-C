/* Programming Exercise 5-6 */

// Now modify the program of Programming Exercise 5 so that it computes the sum of the
// squares of the integers. (If you prefer, how much money you receive if you get $1 the
// first day, $4 the second day, $9 the third day, and so on. This looks like a much better
// deal!) C doesn't have a squaring function, but you can use the fact that the square of n is
// n * n


#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
	int count, sum, end;
	
	count = 0;
	sum = 0;
	printf("Please enter the end:\n");
	scanf("%d", &end);
	while (count++ < end)
		sum = sum + count * count;
	printf("sum = %d", sum);
	
	return 0;
}
